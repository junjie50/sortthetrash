# **Context**:
This game was created for SUTD term 1 project Computational Design Thinking.  
We are creating a game to help those people who wants to recycle but do not know what can be   recycled in the different recycling categories.Since they do not know what can be recycled, they will throw the trash into the general trash category. Since building a habit start from a young age, this game can be used to teach children and teens more interestingly compared to textbooks.We got our inspiration from this article https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/most-singaporeans-care-about-packaging-waste-dont-know-which-materials-are-recyclable-study-1959081

# **Frameworks**
